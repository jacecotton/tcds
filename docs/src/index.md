# Texas Children's Design System Documentation

Welcome to the TCDS component documentation.

## Live Component Example

Below is an example of how you can include live component examples in your documentation:

<div class="example-container" style="padding: 2rem; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <!-- Your live component examples will go here -->
  <p>This is a placeholder for live component examples.</p>
</div>

## Getting Started

Create new Markdown files in this directory to document your components. Each file will automatically generate a page at its corresponding path.

For example:

- `components/button.md` → `/components/button/`
- `components/card.md` → `/components/card/`

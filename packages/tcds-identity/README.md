## @txch/tcds-identity
The **Identity** package of Texas Children's Design System contains all the raw design assets and configuration data related to implementing the Texas Children's digital brand, including:

* Self-hosted font files (including Mont but excluding remotely hosted Calluna)
* Icon files (source SVGs)
* Logo files (source SVGs)
* Design tokens ([DTCG](https://www.designtokens.org/)-compatible JSON)
  * Compiled to SCSS, CSS, and possibly other formats via [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/)
  * Includes tokens for color, layout, motion, surfaces, and typography

`@txch/tcds-identity` is used as a dependency by other Design System packages, including [`@txch/tcds-foundation`](../tcds-foundation/README.md) and [`@txch/tcds-components`](../tcds-components/README.md).

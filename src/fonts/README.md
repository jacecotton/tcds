## Font library
This folder contains our font library.

### Calluna
Calluna is imported directly from our licensed TypeKit endpoint.

### Mont
Mont files are gitignored from the repository. Downstream projects are expected to provide **licensed** source files themselves, as licensing is typically on a site-by-site basis.

To run the Design System locally with Mont support, ensure Mont is installed on your system, and/or that you place a copy of the files in the `src/fonts/mont` directory.

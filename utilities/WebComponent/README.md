## WebComponent
`WebComponent` is a [class mixin](https://justinfagnani.com/2015/12/21/real-mixins-with-javascript-classes/) for [`HTMLElement` interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement). It is not a library or framework, but rather an extremely thin abstraction that brings to [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) declarative templating and reactivity.

In comparison to libraries also based on Web Components, like [Lit](https://lit.dev/) or [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), `WebComponent` deliberately has a much more basic API, introducing few extra utilities or unique concepts. Instead, most work is deferred to vanilla JavaScript and component authors, further embracing the browser's own component model instead of offering a new one.

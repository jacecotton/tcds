## WebComponent
`WebComponent` is a [class mixin](https://justinfagnani.com/2015/12/21/real-mixins-with-javascript-classes/) for [`HTMLElement` interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) to help create [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) with declarative templating and reactive DOM diffing.

This utility deliberately provides little abstraction, instead enforcing or otherwise encouraging certain conventions existing among browser-native HTML elements and enumerated in the [Custom Elements Best Practices](https://web.dev/custom-elements-best-practices/) document. The utility is agnostic as to prop and state handling, event handling, and styling, but guidance is provided in the below conventions for each.

### Defining a component
Defining a Web Component works like defining any other custom element, only instead of extending `HTMLElement` directly, extend it with the `WebComponent` wrapper:

```js
import {WebComponent} from "@txch/tcds";

class MyComponent extends WebComponent(HTMLElement) {

}

customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
```

`<my-component>` can now be used as a valid HTML element on any page with the above script loaded.

You can customize built-in elements by passing the interface of any other HTML element to the `WebComponent` mixin.

```js
class MyComponent extends WebComponent(HTMLUListElement) {

}

customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent, {extends: "ul"});
```

The customized built-in can now be used as `<ul is="my-component">`.

**Note:** Only do this for [elements that can have a shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow#elements_you_can_attach_a_shadow_to). **`WebComponent` is incompatible with elements that cannot.**

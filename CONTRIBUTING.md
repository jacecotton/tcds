## Developing locally
### Step 1. Clone the repository

First, `cd` into the directory you want your local copy of the repository to be. Then run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacecotton/tcds.git
```

Now `cd` into the newly created directory by running

```bash
cd tcds
```

### Step 2. Install dependencies

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then install project dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3. Build and watch for changes

Next, run

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build `src/` files to `dist/` and continuously watch for changes, rebuilding on every save.
